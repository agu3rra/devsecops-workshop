# DevSecOps Mastery Workshop üöÄ

Welcome to the **DevSecOps Mastery Workshop** at SAP! This workshop is designed to challenge your technical skills, creativity, and adaptability in the dynamic field of DevSecOps. Our focus is on your approach and understanding of core concepts, not just the tools you use.

## Important Notes Before You Begin

- **Flexibility in Tools**: While we suggest specific tools like Terraform, Ansible, and AWS, feel free to use any tools or technologies that you are comfortable with. It's your understanding of the concepts and your approach to the problem that we are interested in.
- **Use of External Resources**: You are encouraged to use any kind of assistance, including AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, or resources from the internet. However, we'd like you to rely on these as little as possible, to truly showcase your development skills and problem-solving approach.

## Workshop Objectives üéØ

- **Creativity**: Demonstrate innovative problem-solving and the ability to design custom solutions. We value out-of-the-box thinking and want to see how you tackle new challenges with tools you may not be familiar with.
- **Security**: Implement solutions with a strong focus on security, particularly the principle of least privilege. **Make it secure, make it better.**
- **Adaptability**: Show us how you adapt to new tools, scenarios, and unforeseen challenges.
- **Enjoyment**: Most importantly, have fun! This is a learning experience, and we want you to enjoy the process.

## Duration ‚è±Ô∏è

- **Maximum Time**: **3 Hours**
  - We respect your time and understand you have other commitments. Please do not feel obligated to spend more than 3 hours on this project. Focus on what you're comfortable with and can reasonably achieve within this timeframe.

## IaC Emphasis and Best Practices üèóÔ∏è

In this workshop, we place a strong emphasis on using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automating and managing your cloud infrastructure. We encourage you to utilize IaC tools to their fullest potential:

- **Maximize IaC Usage**: Strive to provision and configure all aspects of your infrastructure using IaC tools like Terraform or Ansible. This includes servers, networking components, logging mechanisms, and any other resources required for your chosen challenge.

## Challenges üõ†Ô∏è

### EC2 and Log Management on AWS

- **Network Infrastructure**: Utilize Terraform/Ansible to set up essential AWS network components, including a VPC, subnets, internet gateway, route tables, and security groups. Ensure the security groups are appropriately configured to open only the necessary ports, with this configuration automated for best security practices.
- **EC2 Instance Setup**: Provision an EC2 Linux instance (we recommend using the latest stable version of Ubuntu or CentOS) using Terraform/Ansible. This instance will act as your primary server.
- **Server Updates**: Include automation in your IaC scripts for regular server updates, ensuring your instance is secure and running the latest software packages.
- **Log Configuration**: Set up your EC2 instance to collect system logs (WARN and ERROR messages). For Ubuntu, use `/var/log/syslog`, and for CentOS, use `/var/log/messages`.
- **Load Balancer Setup**: Implement an AWS Load Balancer to manage incoming traffic and log data efficiently.
- **Log Transfer to S3**: Automate the transfer of collected logs from your EC2 instance to an AWS S3 bucket. This could involve setting up additional AWS services or scripts.
- **S3 Bucket Creation**: Automate the creation of the S3 bucket for storing logs using Terraform/Ansible.

**Note**: The focus of this challenge is on automation using IaC tools and effective log management. While we encourage you to automate as many components as possible, we understand that some parts may need to be configured manually. Please document any manual steps and your reasons for them in your submission.

## Submission Guidelines üìù

- **Create a Personal Repository**: Start by creating a new repository on GitHub for your project. This repository can be private. Once completed, grant access to our team by adding our GitHub usernames as collaborators.
  
- **Documentation**: In your repository, maintain a detailed `docs` folder. Your documentation should include:
- **Project Overview**: A brief description of the chosen challenge and your approach.
- **Technical Details**: Document your architectural decisions, choice of tools, and configurations. Include explanations for both automated and manual steps, especially where automation wasn't feasible.
- **Challenges and Solutions**: Discuss any challenges you encountered and how you resolved them.
- **Security Considerations**: Explain how you implemented security measures, focusing on the principle of least privilege.
- **Future Improvements**: Ideas or plans for enhancing the project if given more time or resources.

- **Code and Configuration**: Ensure all your code, scripts, and configuration files are well-commented and organized in the repository.

- **Presentation**: Prepare a brief presentation (can be a slide deck in the `presentation` folder of your repository) summarizing your project. You will be presenting this to our team, focusing on the architecture, your development process, and key learnings.

- **Final Submission**: Once your project is complete, ensure all your work is pushed to your GitHub repository. Then, email us the link to your repository along with a request to access it.

**Note**: We encourage clarity and thoroughness in your documentation and presentation. This is your opportunity to showcase not only your technical skills but also your ability to communicate and document your work effectively.

## Bonus Points üåü

- Display innovation in your solution or approach.
- Emphasize cost-efficiency and maintainability in your design.
